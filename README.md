Submitting a Solution
If you’re planning to submit a live demo with your student solution, one of the easiest ways to do that is using Repl.it. To do this:

Go to replit.com
Create a new repl
Select Node.js as the language
Enter the url for your submission github repo and click “Import from GitHub”
Click the “Run” button and you should get the URL to your demo in the URL bar of the repl’s web view.
